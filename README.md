# Binary Search
Searches a list faster than "naive search".
<br/><br/>

### Short explanation
Binary search uses a *divide & conquer algorithm* to achieve faster search than "naive search".
Naive search scans each element of a list for a specific target.
Binary search on the other hand splits the list in half and chooses the half of the list where the target would be.
For this to properly work, a list needs to be **sorted**.

* Big-O notation of naive search: O(n)

* Big-O notation of binary search: O(log n)
<br/><br/>

### How to use

Open **binary_search.py** and store a list of numbers in the "numbers" variable at the top. 
Enter a search target where it says "8" by default.
Run the code.
